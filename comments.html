            <p>For my website, I decided to go for a dark theme so that it is less harsh on the eyes as compared to a brighter theme. I did this by changing the <code>background colour</code> of my <code>body</code> element to black in the CSS file. However , this change caused the text to not be visible in my website as its default color is also black. So in my CSS, I selected all my <code>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p</code> and changed their <code>color</code> to white. This made the text white and fixed my problem. 
                <br><br>
            I also opted to use a sidebar in my website to express my creativity and allow for a better user experience as then the user has easy access to all the pages in my website. I implemented the sidebar by first creating a <code>div</code> with the class of “sidebar”. I then put an unordered list inside the “sidebar” div and inside the unordered list I put the list items, which was labelled with the titles of my pages. I then added padding and width to the list items so that they would be spaced out. For better aesthetic I also added a hover pseudo element to the list items, so that their background-color would change when the user would hover over them. I then added a border right property to the div and made its height 100vh, so that it would take up the entire screen of the viewer. I also set its position to fixed so that the sidebar would remain in place when the user scrolled. 
            <br><br>
            Although this created a sidebar, it also caused a problem. And that problem is, my main text content would be covered by the sidebar. To fix this issue, I added a div called “wrapper” which contained all my main content and I gave the wrapper div a margin left of 200px. This shifted the div to the right, and hence preventing the sidebar from covering it.
